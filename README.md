# Ember Inspector [![Build Status](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector/workflows/Build%20and%20Publish/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector/actions?query=branch%3Amaster+workflow%3A%22Build+and+Publish%22)

Adds an Ember tab to the browser's Developer Tools that allows you to inspect
Ember objects in your application.

## Installation

### Chrome

Install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ember-inspector/bmdblncegkenkacieihfhpjfppoconhi).

OR:

- Clone the repository
- cd into the repo directory
- run `yarn install`
- run `yarn global add ember-cli`
- run `yarn build` to build the `dist` directory
- Visit `chrome://extensions` in Chrome
- Make sure `Developer mode` is checked
- Click on 'Load unpacked extension...'
- Choose the `dist/chrome` folder in the cloned repo
- Close and re-open developer tools if it's already open

### Firefox

Install the [Firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ember-inspector/).

OR:

- Clone the repository
- cd into the repo directory
- run `yarn install`
- run `yarn global add ember-cli`
- run `yarn build` to build the `dist` directory
- Visit `about:debugging` in Firefox
- Click on 'Load Temporary Addon-on'
- Choose the `dist/firefox/manifest.json` file in the cloned repo

### Opera

- Clone the repository
- cd into the repo directory
- run `yarn install`
- run `yarn global add ember-cli`
- run `yarn build` to build the `dist` directory
- Visit `chrome://extensions` in Opera
- Make sure `Developer mode` is checked
- Click on 'Load unpacked extension...'
- Choose the `dist/chrome` folder in the cloned repo
- Close and re-open developer tools if it's already open

### Bookmarklet (All Browsers)

```javascript
javascript: (function() { var s = document.createElement('script'); s.src = '//ember-extension.s3.amazonaws.com/dist_bookmarklet/load_inspector.js'; document.body.appendChild(s); }());
```

Internet explorer will open an iframe instead of a popup due to the lack of support for cross-origin messaging.

For development:

- run `yarn serve:bookmarklet`
- create a bookmark (make sure you unblock the popup when you run the bookmarklet):

```javascript
javascript: (function() { var s = document.createElement('script'); s.src = 'http://localhost:9191/bookmarklet/load_inspector.js'; document.body.appendChild(s); }());
```

## Building and Testing:

Run `yarn install && yarn global add ember-cli to install the required modules.

- `yarn build` to build the files in the `dist` directory
- `yarn watch` To watch the files and re-build in `dist` when anything changes (useful during development).
- `yarn test` To run the tests in the terminal
- `yarn start` To start the test server at `localhost:4200/testing/tests`


## Deploy new version:

#### Patch versions

Patch versions are only committed to the stable branch. So we need to cherry-pick the commits we need from master and bump stable to the new patch version.

- `git checkout stable`
- Cherry-pick the needed commits from master to stable.
- Add the change log entry and commit. We use [github-changelog-generator](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator) for this.
  You will want to follow the installation instructions on their README, and take note that you will need to provide a GitHub token.
  Once installed, and you add a token, you can run `yarn changelog` in your terminal.
- `yarn version --patch`
- `git push --tags`
- `git push`
- PR the change log entry to the master branch.

#### Minor and major versions

When releasing a major/minor version, master would already have this version set, so what we need to do is to merge master into stable and release.

- `git checkout stable`
- `git merge -X theirs master`
- Add the change log entry and commit. We use [github-changelog-generator](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator) for this.
  You will want to follow the installation instructions on their README, and take note that you will need to provide a GitHub token.
  Once installed, and you add a token, you can run `yarn changelog` in your terminal.
- `yarn version` (keep the same version number)
- `git push --tags`
- `git push`
- PR the change log entry to the master branch, as well as increment `package.json` to the next major/minor version.

### Locking a version

We can take a snapshot of the current inspector version to support a specific Ember version range. This allows us to stop supporting old Ember versions in master without breaking the published inspector for old Ember apps. It works by serving a different inspector version based on the current app's Ember version.

The Ember versions supported by the current inspector are indicated in the `emberVersionsSupported` array in `package.json`.

Here are the steps to lock an inspector version:

- Release a new version (See "Minor and major versions") if there are unreleased commits in `master`. Skip this step if there are not new commits after the last release.
- Makes sure you have a `config/secrets.json` file with the correct AWS credentials to push to S3. You can use `config/secrets.json.sample` as a starting point.
- Create a new branch (from `stable`) named after the Ember version range that will be supported by this branch. The min version in the range is the first element in the `emberVersionsSupported` array in `package.json`. The max version in the range is the first version that will *not* be supported. For example, a branch named `ember-0.0.0-2.7.0` means it supports Ember 0.0.0 -> 2.6.0, and a branch named `ember-2.7.0-3.4.0` means it supports Ember 2.7.0 -> Ember 3.3.2.
- Update `package.json`'s `emberVersionsSupported`: add a second element that indicates the minimum Ember version the `master` branch *will not* support.
- Commit the branch.
- Run `yarn lock-version`. This will build, compress, and upload this version to S3.
- Checkout the `master` branch.
- Update `package.json`'s `previousEmberVersionsSupported`: add the first Ember version supported by the recently locked snapshot (the first element in the `emberVersionsSupported` array).
- Update `package.json`'s `emberVersionsSupported`: Take the last element from `previousEmberVersionsSupported` and set it as the first element in this array. Set an empty string as the second element to indicate there's currently no maximum Ember version supported yet. `emberVersionsSupported` array length should always be `2` indicating a [min, max] range.
- Commit.

##### Example scenario

Below is an example scenario that assumes the current `master` branch supports Ember version 2.7.0+ and we want to lock the version such that `master` will support 3.4.0+. It also assumes the last Ember Inspector version released was 3.9.0.

- Release a new inspector version `3.10.0` if there are unreleased commits in `master`.
- Create a new branch from `stable` called `ember-2.7.0-3.4.0`.
- Update `package.json`'s `emberVersionsSupported` from `["2.7.0", ""]` to `["2.7.0", "3.4.0"]`.
- Commit with message "Lock Ember version at 2.7.0-3.4.0" and push the branch.
- Run `yarn lock-version`.
- Checkout the `master` branch.
- Create a new branch *from master* called `lock-3.4.0` (branch name here is not important).
- Update `package.json`'s `previousEmberVersionsSupported` from `["0.0.0"]` to `["0.0.0", "2.7.0"]`.
- Update `package.json`'s `emberVersionsSupported` from `["2.7.0", ""]` to `["3.4.0", ""]`.
- Commit and open a PR against `master`.

### Window Messages

The Ember Inspector uses window messages, so if you are using window messages in your application code, make sure you [verify the sender](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.postMessage#Security_concerns) and add checks to your event listener so as not to conflict with the inspector's messages.
