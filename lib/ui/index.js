  // running ember-try, we actually don't care about the "app" side
  // at all â€“ all we do is run the ember_debug tests (via a --filter
  // option to ember test in the ember-try config). The only reason
  // we are even building the app is to get the test harness (qunit
  // and friends) to work. In the long run, we should split up the
  // build and not run the app build in ember-try, but in the mean
  // time, this drops all the addon files (since we don't need them)
  // to avoid the problem. The app will of course not work correctly
  // at runtime, but it was never meant to work on old ember versions
  // in the first place.
